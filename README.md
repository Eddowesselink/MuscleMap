# MuscleMap: An Open-Source, Community-Suppported Consortium for Whole-Body Quantitative MRI of Muscle

This repository includes the documentation, protocol, and scripts for the MuscleMap Consortium.

**Planned MuscleMap Phases:**
1. Develop an Generic Acquisition Protocol for whole-body quantitative MRI of muscle for the most common MR manufacturers
2. Generate an open-source large (nâ‰¥300) annotated multi-site, multi-racial, and multi-ethnic heterogenous whole-body Muscle MRI dataset across the lifespan using the generic acquisition protocol
3. Create an open-source toolbox for automating the analysis of whole-body muscle morphometry and composition

**Current Phase:** We are currently working on developing our Generic Acquisition Protocol for Whole-Body Quantitative MRI of Muscle. You can access the Google doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q7AAnPEr7Rj5gb9d_mLrRnAiav1f32J-RPswvOPk5xE/edit?usp=sharing). To collaborate on the generic acquisition protocol, please contact [Kenneth Weber](mailto:kenweber@stanford.edu) or [Eddo Wesselink](mailto:eddo_wesselink@msn.com).
