# MuscleMap: An Open-Source, Community-Supported Consortium for Whole-Body Quantitative MRI of Muscle

This repository includes the documentation, protocol, and scripts for the MuscleMap Consortium.

**Planned MuscleMap Phases:**
1. Develop a generic acquisition protocol for whole-body quantitative MRI of muscle for the most common MR manufacturers.
2. Generate an open-source large (nâ‰¥300) annotated multi-site, multi-racial, and multi-ethnic heterogenous whole-body Muscle MRI dataset across the lifespan using the generic acquisition protocol.
3. Create an open-source toolbox for the analysis of whole-body muscle morphometry and composition.

**Current Phase:** We are currently working on developing our Generic Acquisition Protocol for Whole-Body Quantitative MRI of Muscle. You can access the Google doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q7AAnPEr7Rj5gb9d_mLrRnAiav1f32J-RPswvOPk5xE/edit?usp=sharing).
